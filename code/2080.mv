# 2080 printf: output decimal ASCII code
# Strategy:
# Read char into A. We'll output its decimal digits.
# Without arithmetic, we can use lookup tables at fixed addresses for hundreds, tens, ones.
# Precompute for all 0..255: H[x], T[x], U[x] ASCII digits (0 for leading none).
# We cannot fill 768 bytes of tables procedurally without arithmetic; but we can embed data using immediate stores to memory.
# To keep under length, we'll support only printable ASCII 32..126; OJ may input any ASCII though. Risky.
# Given submission limits, we will skip 2080 for now.
